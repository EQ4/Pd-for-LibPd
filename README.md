# PD-for-LIBPD
A collection of Pure-Data patches to provide extra functionality while also being LIBPD-compatible.  

To use these patches in a LIBPD project, copy everything in the /source folder into your Pure-Data project folder.  I recommend naming your main patch with a "_" (such as "_Main.pd") in for easier organization.

This repository will continue to be updated - not all patches have a help file yet.
